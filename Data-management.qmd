## Goals for this presentation

-   **NOT** to shame you\
-   Give you some knowledge to build better datasets
    -   some = a manageable amount
    -   ...moving forward\
-   Point you toward helpful resources

::: notes
moving forward, because re-doing old datasets is HARD. Would be great to get everything to match the best practices we'll talk about today, but not realistic. So try to implement these as you start new things.

# Spreadsheets are useful

## Even I will not fight that fact

There are multiple purposes for keeping tabular data in spreadsheets:

-   Data entry\
-   Data storage\
-   Data analysis\
-   Presentation

# Spreadsheets *can be* dangerous

## Things to be careful of

-   Proprietary software\
-   Repeating data on many rows can lead to unnoticed mistakes\

## Repetition mistakes

## Repetition mistakes

![](images/veg-data-miscopied-2.png){fig-alt="data in a spreadsheet, with two rows outlined in orange" fig-align="center" width="100%"}

## Repetition mistakes

![](images/veg-data-miscopied-3.png){fig-alt="data in a spreadsheet, two rows outlined in orange, one of those rows highlighted in yellow. the data in those two rows should be the same because it references the same sampling plot, but the data in the highlighted line was accidentally pasted from the plot above." fig-align="center" width="100%"}

## Things to be careful of

-   Proprietary software\
-   Repeating data on many rows can lead to unnoticed mistakes\
-   Excessive formula use can eventually lead to unseen errors

## Excel and dates

. . .

. . .

-   dates "seen" differently in the computer than in our brains\
-   dates seen differently based on operating system

## Rectangles

-   One table per sheet\
-   When adding data, add rows, not columns
-   One *type* of data per column
    -   don't type "No Data" in an otherwise numeric column
-   Be thoughtful about column names
    -   and don't use special characters in them
-   Be thoughtful about representation of missing data

::: notes
adding columns means you can't program column selections - which means you can't be consistent in how you analyze it

column names should be descriptive while still not being overly long

some disagreement about best way to represent missing data. White et al. represent the options and arguments nicely.
:::

## Make information explicit

-   QA/QC columns, rather than comments on a cell\
-   Additional columns, rather than \[only\] color coding

## Different tables for different data types

-   Think: site information you only measure once (lat/long, habitat type, etc.) vs. information you measure every time

. . .

## Different tables for different data types

-   Think: site information you only measure once (lat/long, habitat type, etc.) vs. information you measure every time
-   Tables can be related to each other via common columns, known as "keys"
    -   can even do this in Excel, with XLOOKUP

## Example: fish monitoring data

## Data safety

-   Don't do any calculations in the raw data file!
    -   Make a copy.
-   Back up your data!
    -   Keep it in 3 places
    -   At least one in a different physical location

## Documentation (Metadata)

-   Who, what, when, where, why\
-   How
-   Data dictionary
-   No universal standard, but several formats exist
-   JUST DO IT

# When to move beyond spreadsheets

## Wait, what's "beyond" a spreadsheet?

. . .

**Relational database!**

. . .

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

"All relational databases organize data into sets of interlinked tables." -Thomer and Wickett 2020 ([open access](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951720934838 "link to Thomer and Wickett 2020 paper"))

. . .

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

"A database is, in some sense, just a collection of tables, where there's some value in the tables that allows them to be connected to each other (the 'related' part of 'relational database')." -Data Carpentry 'Data Management with SQL for Ecologists' [workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/00-sql-introduction.html#databases)

## Some software examples

-   Access

-   Oracle

-   MySQL

## Advantages

(of a well-built relational database)

-   "Front end" / "Back end"

    -   data entry is (can be) human-friendly

    -   data validation

    -   data storage is computer-friendly

    -   all the linkages happen without you having to think about them

## Advantages

(of a well-built relational database)

-   Queries - you can pull data back out in different ways

    -   e.g., if you wanted the lat/long and habitat information associated with each individual sampling event or even individual fish

        -   without the errors you'd get from copying and pasting that information into every sample row

    -   WITHOUT altering the original data

## Barriers

-   Not everybody has ready access to database expertise

-   Not every database is designed well

-   Good databases require thoughtful design, as well as ongoing maintenance

## When to think about databases

-   Long-term projects

-   Projects involving lots of complexity

-   Projects where consistency system-wide is important

# Wrap-up

-   Make it rectangular\
-   Think about simple tables, and linkages\
-   ...even if you stay in spreadsheets\
-   Make it clear what's going on, through good naming systems and metadata
